# OpenHPSDR Protocol 1 — Annotated Capture Reference (Hermes Lite 2)

This document is the byte-level ground-truth reference for OpenHPSDR
Protocol 1 as implemented by Hermes Lite 2 firmware, derived from a
single live capture of a Thetis-class host talking to an HL2 over a
direct link-local Ethernet connection. Every layout claim in this doc
is backed by a hex dump from the capture and a Thetis `NetworkIO.cs`
source citation. NereusSDR Phase 3L (P1 support) implements against
this document.

## 1. Capture Metadata

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| File | `HL2_Packet_Capture.pcapng` (~324 MB) |
| Frames | 302,256 total (302,252 IPv4/UDP, 4 ARP) |
| Duration | ~55.7 s session (+ ~4 s DHCP tail) |
| Host | `169.254.105.135` (link-local) |
| Radio (HL2) | `169.254.19.221`, UDP port `1024` |
| Discovery | host `:50533` → broadcast `:1024`, reply from radio |
| Session | host `:50534` ↔ radio `:1024` |
| Direction split | 281,195 frames radio→host (EP6), 21,049 frames host→radio (EP2) |

The capture is a single clean session: discovery → start → steady-state
RX → stop. Subsequent sections walk through each phase.
